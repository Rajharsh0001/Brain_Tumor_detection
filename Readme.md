# 🧠 Brain Tumor Prediction Using Deep Learning  

## 📘 Overview  

This project focuses on **detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans** using a **deep learning model** built with **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2 / CNN)**.  
It provides an end-to-end workflow — from preprocessing medical images to training, evaluating, and visualizing prediction results.
